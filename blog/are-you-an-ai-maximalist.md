# Are you an AI maximalist?

No.

---
Okay I could stop there, but let me explain a bit more:  

I don't care about selling GPUs (anymore...),
and I won't talk about doomsday scenarios
or tell whoever listens that "AI is here to say and we should shove it everywhere".

I don't believe every product should have AI, I don't even like calling "it" "AI".
And I _work_ in the field!

What I do believe is that big and small LLMs are an interesting tool, even more so when you make agents out of them.

"agent with big LLM for coding" is an interesting application of the tech, and it is undeniably usefull.

This is not "AI replaces developers" and it's not "AI is just autocomplete" either.  
How you use the tool is somewhere on a spectrum: from not using it, having copilot reviewing a PR,
to full on [Gas Town](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/welcome-to-gas-town-4f25ee16dd04)
where you orchestrate teams of teams of agents.

In the middle of the spectrum, there are many high value, low risk use cases.  
You'll find some examples here, setting up a review board, or writting docs, or chores,
like checking for misalignment between the doc and the code, ...

You'll also find some [experiments](/blog/claude-and-stt-web) which are more far sided of the spectrum.
