# writing for a living

>"It seems that you've been living two lives. In one life, you're Thomas A. Anderson, program writer for a respectable software company. You have a Social Security number, you pay your taxes, and you help your landlady carry out her garbage. The other life is lived in computers, where you go by the hacker alias 'Neo' and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for. One of these lives has a future, and one of them does not."

I _am_ living two lives.

In one life, I am Thomas C. ~~Anderson~~, slack&specs (sometimes specs in slack) writer for a respectable sotfware&hardware company.

Writing for humans.  
I discovered while snooping in slack that I am the #1 "Regular Member" by number of messages posted in the company slack.  
I write ~200 slack messages per active day.  
Add to this docs, slides, JIRA tickets.  

The other life is lived in computers,  

Writing for machines  
Prompts, system instructions, specs for agent teams, seed datasets, role definitions, CLAUDE.md files.
