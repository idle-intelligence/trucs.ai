# Claude and the Swarm

*A series about using Claude Code agent teams on a side project.*

Building the [Hive/Swarm](/swarm) — a P2P swarm where browser tabs run small LLMs and contribute inference to a collective. Three agent teams: one trained the classifier, one shipped the feature, one reviewed the code.
