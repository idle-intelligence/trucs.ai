# ilnmtlbnm

I started coding at 9 yo, building games in BASIC on an Amstrad CPC 464.
(Yes, the one with cassette tapes in lieu of disks)

I've trained as an Engineer,
half Computer Science for Computer Simulation (think, FORTRAN),
half Fluid Mechanics.

After my PhD in Physics at ESPCI@Paris,
I briefly worked in the exciting world of 300°C 200bar gluten processing,
but ended up co-founding a startup in the US.

Already, it was about measuring things with fast "small" inference,
and seeing what more could emerge from the scale of many of those.

Currently [writing for a living](/blog/writing-for-a-living) and playing with Claude.
